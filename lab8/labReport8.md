## Assignment 1

The signal shown in the scope is a pulse every 256 time units. It occurs on time unit 25 of that period. This can be interpreted as a slower clock at the scope. The purpose of such a signal is to act as a slower clock.

## Assignment 2

Every time scope 1 give a pulse, the output scope takes a step up. This new behavior is that of a slower counter.

One could make an even slower counter by adding another compare to constant and HDL counter in series. To speed the circuit up, one could change the value of the first coutner that it resets at.
