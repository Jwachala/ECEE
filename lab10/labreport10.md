Here we see the singal on for only part of the cycle, that part being the 1.5ms it's on.

## Assignment 1

Here, the arm is disabled, so it stays at angle 0 using the pulse width shown.

## Assignment 2

The first two graphs don't show anything as those componemts are disabled. However, the third graph shows the 'position 0' PWM pulse, being supplied as expected.

![right pulse][img2.3]

First pulse width: 30 time units = .6ms. Second pulse width: 36 time units = .72ms.

![left pulse 2][img2.4]

![right pulse 2][img2.5]

First pulse width: 30 time units = .6ms. Second pulse width: 24 Time units = .48ms.

This result is as expected, as the counter starts at a 30 time unit width, and going down a pulse width increment (6 time units) would bring it to 24 time units. This has no meaning for the robot arm, being out of range, but is as expected for the construction of this circuit.
